# pokerchips
This webapp hosted on AWS elastic beanstalk allows the counting of poker chips easily, for the times when you don't have coins or chips available.

I was inspired to build this application when my friends and I were stuck under a shelter with nothing but a pack of cards and our phones. (we went biking. it rained.) We tried to play poker but it got really messy... But now ---- no chips, no problem! ðŸ˜‰
